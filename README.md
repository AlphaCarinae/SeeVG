# SeeVG

## About

SeeVG is an attempt on creating an SVG editor as an excuse to work with SVG elements. I liked the concept behind vector graphics and I decided that is something I wanna try.

try the application [here](https://alphacarinae.github.io/SeeVG/#/)

## Features

For now you can draw lines, rectangles, circles and ellipses on the page.
you can select one or more items by using the pointing hand, once an item selected, the tools on the left can be used to change line width, color, fillcolor and opacity of the fillcolor of selected items.

Once values are set in tools they will be used to draw the next item on the screen.

Once you are done with the drawing you can use the menu options to copy the reusable inline-HTML code in your browser or save the svg file to your computer.


## Technology

This is a Single Page Application in ReactJS. 


## Responsiveness

SeeVG has been done with responsiveness in mind and the elements' arrangement changes once the screen goes below 700px in width.
