# SeeVG

## About

SeeVG is an attempt on creating an SVG editor as an excuse to work with SVG elements. I liked the concept behind vector graphics and I decided that is something I wanna try.

## Features

For now you can draw lines, rectangles, circles and ellipses on the page.
you can select one or more items by using the pointing hand, once an item selected, the tools on the left can be used to change line width, color, fillcolor and opacity of the fillcolor of selected items.

Once values are set in tools they will be used to draw the next item on the screen.
